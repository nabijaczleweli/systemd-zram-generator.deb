#[zram0]

# The maximum amount of memory (in MiB). If the machine has more RAM
# than this, zram device will not be created.
#
# "memory-limit = none" may be used to disable this limit.
#
# The default is 2048 MiB, i.e. the device is only created on machines
# with limited memory:
#memory-limit = 2048

# The fraction of memory to use as ZRAM. For example, if the machine
# has 1 GiB, and zram-fraction=0.25, then the zram device will have
# 256 MiB. Values in the range 0.10â€“0.40 are recommended.
#
# The default is 0.25:
#zram-fraction = 0.25

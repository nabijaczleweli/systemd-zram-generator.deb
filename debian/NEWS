systemd-zram (1.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  1. Upstream now supports the zram-size configuration variable,
     replacing the now-deprecated zram-fraction and max-zram-size
     (they continue to work, but write warnings to the journal).

     A configuration file can be migrated by replacing those fields
     with a single declaration in the form
       zram-size = min(ram * ${zram-fraction}, ${max-zram-size})

     The arithmetic DSL supports most notation, log, trig,
     and logic functions, cf. zram-generator.conf(5).
     The default value is unchanged at min(ram / 2, 4096).

  2. Upstream now also supports writeback-device,
     correspoding to the backing_dev zram file,
     to which incompressible pages are written under memory pressure.
     It's unset by default.

  3. memory-limit has long been deprecated, but there's now a warning,
     like for zram-fraction and max-zram-size, too:
     upgrade to host-memory-limit

systemd-zram (0.2.0~beta.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    Starting with this release, systemd-zram now uses liboverdrop[1] for finding
    configuration fragments and drop-ins, a la systemd.unit(5).

    The defaults for the following [zramX] entries have changed:
      * zram-fraction:     0.25 -> 0.5
      * host-memory-limit: 2048 -> None
      * host-memory-limit: 0 now disables any previous configuration of the
        device.

    The ucf setup has not changed, but take additional care with merging this
    updated config.

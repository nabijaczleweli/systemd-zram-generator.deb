- instead of using the shell in the service file, consider calling the generator
  binary again and doing the initalization from it.
- logging in generators needs to go to kmsg, println!() is not enough.
- add a testing mode where, if $ZRAM_GENERATOR_ROOT=... is set, and do everything
  relative to this path then.
- figure out how to tell cargo to install into
  /usr/lib/systemd/system-generators not /usr/bin
- make swap priority configurable?
- read configuration also from /usr/lib?
